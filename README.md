# Kevin's SQL Porfolio

## Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! Feel free to look around and to ask any questions you may have. 

This will be my code repository for all my future SQL projects. As I go through learning new ways to query using SQL, I will add that here with comments about what my queries perform. I will start with queries from example databases from the Break into Tech program. Eventually I look to create my own SQL databases to get comfortable creating databases as well as querying them.
